# README master branch
* master branch is a copy of the archive as it was originally developed for posting on sites other than github pages
* (you can tell it's old because of the offensive use of the word 'master')
* I'm keeping it just for archival purposes.
* It does not include the tracks .zip file -- it was too big for github
* The forweb directory contains compiling notes for compiling .tex as a .html page. May be vaguely useful for some project in the future.
