class="cmti-10">This is a mix I made for my 15 year old sister Emma. At some point in her life</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Emma will be at a party full of cool smart people, and someone will ask her</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">to pick some music to play. I would hope (as my sister) she would have</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">the confidence to choose music in such a way that it jams the party right</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">into the appropriate gear. The songs selected here are not obscure hidden</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">gems, or challenging boundary pushers (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">boundary pushing), just some of my favorite tracks from some of the most</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">important people in the history of pop music. But since I don&#8217;t think it is fair</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">to just dump music on someone and expect them to try to figure out why</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">it is good, I wrote some brief descriptions to help fill in the story for her.</span>
<span

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Blind Willie Johnson</h3>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >In the beginning, before the Beatles, before Bob Dylan, and before Crosby Stills
Nash and Young, there was a crazy artist living in New York City named Harry
Smith. He collected records of old-timey mountain folks from the south, singing songs
passed down from one family member to another for generations. You saw <span 
class="cmti-10">Oh</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Brother, Where art thou? </span>right?&#8212;that&#8217;s what the songs were like. In the 1950s Harry
made the most famous music mix of all time. He put all his favorite songs
out on six records called <span 
class="cmti-10">The Anthology of American Folk Music</span>. All the
cool people in NYC and London listened to those records. They listened
to the Anthology until they wore out the needles of their record players.
They couldn&#8217;t get enough. Those records had jug bands, and blues songs;
murder ballads, and dudes who slid their knife up and down the guitar strings
to make crazy sounds. Nobody had ever heard anything like it before. (At
least not coming out of a record player.) And then the cool people started

writing their own songs, imitating the styles they heard on the Anthology
records. By then it was the 1960s and the cool people were forming their own
bands. They wanted their bands to sound kind of like what they heard on the
Anthology, and this became what you know as &#8220;folk&#8221; music. Now, every song
on the Anthology is a piece of musical history, and the Anthology songs
influenced all sorts of people (including Bob Dylan who, as you know, is kind of
a big deal.) But Blind Willie is the hole in the middle of the Anthology
around which the record of musical history spun. In a whole collection of
songs sounding like nothing else before, his song: <span 
class="cmbx-10">John the Revelator</span>,
demanded the particular attention of the cool people. It sounded like it
had come from some place deep in America&#8217;s past, and at the same time it
had a message for all of humanity&#8217;s future. And all the cool people felt bad
because the guy who had written this song they loved so much had lived
and died in a racist system, which meant none of them had even gotten
to shake the fellow&#8217;s hand. He was kind of a mysterious figure. Not much
is known about him except he was blind because his mom threw a pan of
lye (a cleaning chemical) in his face when he was a kid&#8212;hence the name.
A lot of the songs on the Anthology were about nasty things, things just
as nasty as getting lye thrown in your face, but Blind Willie Johnson was
deeply religious. His songs were mostly about God. It sometimes seemed
like he stood with one foot planted on earth and the other on some higher
plane. Maybe he was a prophet. But even if he was just a poor, blind, devout
dude with a gravelly voice, he recorded some of the most important songs in
the history of humanity. One of his songs is actually on board the Voyager
spacecraft&#8212;which became the first spacecraft to leave the solar system a couple
of years ago. (And, also, is the evil alien force in Star Trek, The Motion
Picture.)

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>James Brown</h3>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >Have you listened to any James Brown yet? If you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s time to start. His
backing band was made up of some of the greatest musicians who ever lived. Nobody
could play like those guys. And the music they made, sometimes called soul,
sometimes called funk, set the basis for dance music for the next 50 years. (Dance
music&#8212;you know, music you dance to, as opposed to the kind you sit around and
sing along with&#8212;is a pretty important part of music.) He started putting these songs
out in the 1960s, and when people heard those songs, they just <span 
class="cmti-10">had </span>to start
dancing. They couldn&#8217;t help it. The lyrics could be ridiculous sometimes, but
the music was an unstoppable dance force. Before James Brown, dancing
was kinda boring (there were a lot of rules for how to do it right). After
him, it was fun. Turns out people like fun dancing a lot more than boring
dancing. This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Mother Popcorn </span>is about popcorn. And mothers,
apparently.

<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Leonard Cohen</h3>
<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Lots of people (ELA teachers mostly) complain that most people don&#8217;t like poetry
anymore. But this isn&#8217;t true at all. What actually happened is the greatest poets of
the 20th century happened to prefer writing rock songs to writing &#8220;poetry.&#8221;
And nobody <span 
class="cmti-10">ever </span>complains that not enough people like rock songs, right?
Leonard Cohen is a Canadian dude who is one of the greatest song writers of
all time. (A lot of people think he is one of the greatest poets of all time
too.) He started writing songs in the 1960s. He was probably one of the cool
people listening to the Anthology of American Folk Music like everyone else.
He wrote that song <span 
class="cmti-10">Suzanne </span>(&#8220;...brings you tea and oranges, that come all
the way from China&#x2026;&#8221;&#8212;you know the one.) And he also wrote a famous
song called <span 
class="cmti-10">Hallelujah </span>which you would recognize if you heard it. He wrote
dozens of songs in which the way he constructs his lyrics will give you chills,
if you give them a chance. Your Uncle Kevin says, &#8220;The man has class,
heart, and cool.&#8221; This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Famous Blue Raincoat</span>, is one of his best.
One of the best songs ever written should be about a raincoat, don&#8217;t you
think?
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40004"></a>Serge Gainsbourg</h3>
<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Serge Gainsbourg was a French man you never heard of. He was an ugly little troll
who all the most beautiful women in the world were in love with because he wrote
amazing songs. He too was a poet writing rock music. But his songs were in French,
so most Americans have never heard his stuff. The music is complex, but
still catchy. Like James Brown, he would hire the best musicians to play
for him. And if you listen to enough, somehow you can just tell the lyrics
are deeply poetic and tricky, even though you don&#8217;t understand them in
French. <span 
class="cmbx-10">The Ballad of Melody Nelson </span>is one song from a whole album
about a girl riding a bicycle who he hits with his Rolls Royce&#8212;and then falls
in love with. It is considered one of the greatest albums ever recorded (in
French).
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50005"></a>Dolly Parton</h3>
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >Dolly Parton is one of the few people included in this list who is both a world-class
singer and a world-class songwriter at the same time. Her singing is shocking&#8212;just
listen to it&#8212;she has access to vocal registers that &#8220;cut you to the quick&#8221; as your old
humbug wizard would say. Her voice just tears right through your sad little heart.
But the thing that makes Dolly special is she pairs her voice with the exceptionally
good songs she writes. Leonard Cohen probably writes better lyrics than Dolly
Parton (well he pretty much writes better lyrics than <span 
class="cmti-10">everybody</span>) but he can&#8217;t back

his lyrics up with a voice like Dolly Parton&#8217;s. And when she puts those two things
together it becomes something that makes you feel like it might spoil your
reasonable sense of what other good music might sound like. Dolly makes
country music of course. And the best country songs are either really funny, or
terribly sad, like this one: <span 
class="cmbx-10">I Will Always Love You</span>. She has funny ones
too.
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60006"></a>Johnny Cash</h3>
<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Johnny Cash you know, because you saw that movie. But you should listen to a lot
<span 
class="cmti-10">more </span>Johnny Cash. He did not write many of his own songs, and is not one of the
great song writers like other folks I&#8217;ve been talking about. Mostly he took other
people&#8217;s great songs and through some kind of magic I can&#8217;t figure out, he
made them matter a lot more. Sometimes even when the original song was
<span 
class="cmti-10">terrible</span>. My guess is his trick was using his stripped-down style to make other
people&#8217;s ridiculous and overly fancy songs, simple and sad (&#x2026;or funny!) It
didn&#8217;t hurt that he had the mega-rock-star status thing going for him. This
song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">A Boy Named Sue </span>was written by Shel Silverstein. (You remember
that book <span 
class="cmti-10">Where the Sidewalk Ends</span>?&#8212;same guy.) He played it for the first
time in San Quentin prison. That part is in the movie. The second most
important dude in the history of country music is Merle Haggard. He was <span 
class="cmti-10">at</span>
the show Johnny Cash played in San Quentin&#8212;because he was in prison
there.
<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70007"></a>Nancy Sinatra</h3>
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >Nancy Sinatra is the daughter of Frank Sinatra. (You know who he was, right?) Most
people think she sings pretty well. (Though she&#8217;s no Dolly Parton.) She sang more
than one James Bond theme song. And she sang that song <span 
class="cmti-10">These Boots Are Made</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">For Walking</span>. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard it. But like Johnny Cash, she didn&#8217;t write most of
her songs. (For a lot of performers back then, and even today, it&#8217;s pretty
normal to have someone else write your songs.) She had a friend named Lee
Hazlewood who wrote all of her most famous songs. And he <span 
class="cmti-10">was </span>one of the great
song writers. But he wasn&#8217;t a terrific singer, so he usually got Nancy to
sing for him (smart, huh?). More people know <span 
class="cmti-10">These Boots Are Made For</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Walking</span>, but this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Sand</span>, is one of the best that Lee and Nancy ever did
together.
<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80008"></a>Kraftwerk</h3>

<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >Kraftwerk are a couple of German guys who also happen to be the most influential
band in the history of music. You&#8217;ve heard of the Beatles right? Kraftwerk is more
influential than they are. Then why have you never heard of Kraftwerk? Because
mostly it was other musicians who listened to them. A <span 
class="cmti-10">lot </span>of other musicians. People
who worked in a far wider range of musical styles than the Beatles. The special thing
Kraftwerk did was they made pop music with electronic instruments. Mostly
keyboards. That sounds boring now, but nobody did it before them. And
<span 
class="cmti-10">everyone </span>did it after them because they thought Kraftwerk were so cool. Any
band you have ever heard with a keyboard in it, or a drum machine, or uses
clips from other music, probably was listening to Kraftwerk at some point.
This includes <span 
class="cmti-10">all </span>the pop music from the 1980s, and <span 
class="cmti-10">all </span>the dance music
from the 1970s and 1980s. (Like, say, disco&#8212;maybe you&#8217;ve heard of that?)
Remember, dance music is an enormous part of the history of music. Even <span 
class="cmti-10">all </span>of
the early rap and hip hop musicians were listening to Kraftwerk! For some
reason the guys in the Bronx who started rapping in the 1980s (creating a
whole new genre of music) thought this obscure band from Germany was
awesome. But Kraftwerk wasn&#8217;t just using new instruments to break new ground
in musical history. Their songs were also amazing little puzzles which are
always about two things at once. The songs have simple melodies, with simple
lyrics, and simple singing. But if you pay close attention you&#8217;ll realize the
songs are special little things you can listen to over and over again, and hear
a new meaning in the lyrics every time. Like any great music. This song,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Radioactivity </span>is both about radioactivity and about radios. With activity on
them.
<!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90009"></a>Parliament</h3>
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" >Parliament (or P-funk) played a lot of their best stuff in the 1970s and they kind of
picked up where James Brown left off. Like James Brown, they crammed as many
people on stage as they could. And all of the people on stage were world-class
musicians. They wrote crazy songs about aliens coming down from outer space to
make you dance. Parliament&#8217;s music was considered funk because they weren&#8217;t using
too many electronic instruments. (After them, when dance groups switched to using
lots of electronic instruments, people started calling it disco.) They had a real
drummer and real instruments and funky beats. But their style was kind
of like the crazy electronic dance music that was right around the corner.
(Made by all those people listening to Kraftwerk, who thought computer
music and keyboards were cool.) The song here is <span 
class="cmbx-10">Flashlight</span>, which has the
chorus, &#8220;everybody has a little light under the sun.&#8221; What do you think that
means?
<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1000010"></a>Brian Eno</h3>
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >Also in the 1970s (you had no idea the 1970s were so important to music, did you?)
there was this guy Brian Eno. Brian Eno knew every musician in NYC and London.
And they all wanted him to &#8220;produce&#8221; their albums. (That just means deciding
which instruments to use on a song and how loud each instrument should be&#8212;turns
out, this is important for making a song sound good.) Eno was some kind of genius
producer, as if God had reached down and tapped him on the head and said,
&#8220;thou shalt produce!&#8221; He claimed not to know anything about music, but
every album he touched magically turned into a classic of pop music. He
produced records for Roxy Music, The Velvet Underground, U2, Talking
Heads, Genesis, David Bowie, Devo, and piles of others. But, and this is a big
but, he also wrote songs himself which have astonishing twisting lyrics that
sometimes tell creepy stories, and sometimes make you fall in love. And his songs
sound like nothing else before or since. If you are talking about pop music,
he is one of the most talented people to ever adjust the sound levels on a
recording. And this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I&#8217;ll Come Running</span>, is one of the best he ever wrote
himself.
<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1100011"></a>Donna Summer</h3>
<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >Donna Summer is famous for her disco songs. And what amazing disco songs they
are! The lyrics aren&#8217;t much, but her voice just soars. Her secret weapon though was a
guy named Giorgio Moroder. He was another producer with a gift for turning
other people&#8217;s songs into pop hits. Not just ordinary pop hits&#8212;if you listen
closely, the sounds he creates are complicated and have lots of smaller sounds
mushed together to create them. He used more electronics and computers
than Brian Eno. His stuff sounded more like Kraftwerk. Many of the best
songs of the disco era had Giorgio Moroder standing behind them, listening
to headphones, and twiddling knobs until they sounded just perfect. He
turned this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I Feel Love</span>, by Donna Summer into a work of art. When
Brian Eno heard it, he said, &#8220;I have heard the sound of the future.&#8221; At least,
that&#8217;s what David Bowie says he said. One way or another, this song turned
dance music from funk (with real instruments) into disco (with electronic
instruments.)
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1200012"></a>Patti Smith</h3>
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" >At the same time that Donna Summer was changing pop music, Patti Smith was
changing punk rock. Before her, punk rock was just a just bunch of dudes getting
drunk and breaking things and yelling &#8220;anarchy!&#8221; (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong
with that.) Patti Smith brought art and poetry and angry women to punk rock. Her
songs are intense and full of imagery (like images of, say, horses.) And her band does

the awesome thing where they start off soft and build up until you have to put
your fingers in your ears and if you squint you can almost see raw energy
pouring off the stage. Lots of the best bands do this kind of thing. She is
another person who knew every famous person who passed through NYC in
the 1970s. Bruce Springsteen thought she was so cool he gave her one of
his best songs! (<span 
class="cmti-10">Because The Night</span>.) This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Land</span>, is the centerpiece
of her album <span 
class="cmti-10">Horses</span>&#8212;one of the most important albums in the history of
music.
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1300013"></a>Talking Heads</h3>
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" >Ok. Yet another guy living in NYC in the 1970s and 80s, named David Byrne, had a
band called <span 
class="cmti-10">Talking Heads</span>. They wrote fun pop songs which sounded good in the car
when you were driving home from work. But the lyrics were about serial killers, and
arson, and the end of the world. Like Parliament and James Brown, David Byrne had
the good sense to pack the stage with unbelievable musicians and (you may
remember) have Brian Eno produce his albums. He topped it off by having awesome
designers and artists do his album covers. Every cool person in the world likes
Talking Heads. No joke. Go ahead and ask anyone cool you meet. If you are
ever at a party full of cool people and someone asks you to put some music
on, just throw on some Talking Heads. Everyone will think you have good
taste in music, but all you did was pick the one band every cool person
likes. This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Nothing But Flowers</span>, is about eating chocolate chip
cookies after the apocalypse. It&#8217;s my favorite. One of the backup singers
on this song is Kirsty MacColl. She was part of the Pogues too, as you&#8217;ll
see.
<!--l. 307--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1400014"></a>Tom Waits</h3>
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >Tom Waits sings with a gravelly low voice which is supposed to make you think he
drank too much whiskey and smoked too many cigarettes. Maybe he did, maybe he
didn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s the shtick. Why does he want you to think that? Because you&#8217;re
supposed to believe his main job is singing for tips in a crappy bar. But don&#8217;t be
fooled, this guy is one of the finest musicians there is. And he packs his albums and
shows full of world-class backup musicians. And then on top of the music he lays
down tricky, funny, touching, lyrics full of plays on words which make you giggle.
(They&#8217;re &#8220;punny&#8221;!) All that, and all you have to do is learn to like a little
bit of a gravelly voice. Really, his voice isn&#8217;t even as bad as Bob Dylan&#8217;s,
and you know how much people will put up with to listen to <span 
class="cmti-10">that </span>guy&#8217;s
songs. This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Strange Weather</span>, is one of the best songs nobody you
know has ever heard. It&#8217;s about talking about the weather. And not buying
umbrellas.

<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">15   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1500015"></a>The Pogues</h3>
<!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >The Pogues were an Irish rock band. They had this awesome idea that if you
combined traditional Irish music (you know jigs, reels, and whatnot) with punk and
rock music, you could make a really <span 
class="cmti-10">really </span>popular band. They were right. They were
so right that nowadays there are about 1000 bands which sound just like the Pogues.
But the Pogues were there first, and they are a way better band than all the rest.
Why? Because there&#8217;s like nine dudes in the Pogues and every one of them is among
the best in the world at playing his instrument. (Yet another band using that
technique! Funny how well it works.) But lots of the other Irish rock bands have
good musicians. The Pogues also had Shane MacGowan writing songs for
them. Songs just poured out of Shane MacGowan. It seemed like he didn&#8217;t
even have to try. He just threw words out there and they would somehow
fit the jig, and the reel, and the rock, in a way that gave you shivers. The
only problem was he was so drunk all the time you couldn&#8217;t understand a
damn word he said. The band eventually kicked him out for being drunk.
But then they had to let him back in, because without him they were just
like all the other bands that sound like the Pogues. People like well-played
music, but they <span 
class="cmti-10">love </span>a catchy lyric and a good turn of phrase. This song,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Fairytale of NY</span>, is a duet with Kirsty MacColl (who sang with Talking
Heads, remember?) Her voice is shocking. Particularly on the lines, &#8220;you
could have been someone&#8212;well so could anyone!&#8221; (The producer did a trick
on that part&#8212;the vocals are doubled up so they sound like more than one
person singing.) She died young, saving her son from being run over by a
motorboat. Which makes that song, and that part of the song particularly, kind
of sad. But kind of sad in a good way. In Europe this song has actually
become a Christmas classic, and people play it a lot during the holidays
(probably an annoying amount.) Nick Cave says the first line is the greatest
first line ever written. That&#8217;s a pretty impressive endorsement, as you&#8217;ll
see.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">16   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1600016"></a>Nirvana</h3>
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >In the 1990s everyone was miserable. Mostly because they had to wear ugly clothes
that didn&#8217;t fit, and have bad haircuts, and nobody took showers. Plus, all the music
and movies just weren&#8217;t as good as they were in the 1960s, &#8217;70s, and &#8217;80s. And
nothing exciting ever happened. Because of the miserable situation, all the bands
started singing about how miserable they all were, and nobody was more miserable
than Kurt Cobain. So of course that meant he had the most popular band of the
time. He also had a gift for writing good songs. They are one of those bands proving
once again you can learn the bare minimum of actual music, but if you know

how to twist a phrase in a catchy way, and set it to a good simple hook of
music, people will worship the ground you walk on like a conquering king
of old. And the worship their king the people did, and they called their
kingdom Grunge. Of course that didn&#8217;t stop Kurt Cobain from killing himself.
Most of Nirvana&#8217;s songs were pretty noisy, but this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">All Apologies</span>,
probably captures what it felt like to live in the 1990s more than any other song
written.

<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >In the 1990s popular rock music was getting boring. Everything kind of
sounded the same, nobody was doing anything new. At the same time, popular
hip-hop was just launching a period which would eventually change the arc of
music history affecting people right up until today. In the 1960s folk music
changed everything. In the 2000s hip-hop changed everything. But before that
happened, in the early 1990s, there was a battle going on in hip-hop between the
East Coast (which mostly means NYC) and the West Coast (which mostly
means Los Angeles). In 1993 the West Coast was winning. Their hip-hop was
was serious and dark. Nothing the East Coast made could stand up to it.
Until some dudes in NYC did what NYC always does&#8212;they got smart.
Enter the Wu-Tang Clan. The hip-hop band that eventually became Staten
Island&#8217;s greatest cultural export. They put out an album in 1994 called
<span 
class="cmti-10">Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) </span>which changed the way hip-hop worked.
Wu-Tang is yet another group with the great idea of cramming as many
super-talented people on stage as they could fit. Each member would take
turns rapping a verse, and the verses were just as serious and dark as the
Los Angeles stuff, but also incredibly intelligent, tricky, loaded with double
meaning, and somehow funny at the same time. Wu-Tang combined darkness
with intelligence in a way that just wiped the slate of West Coast versus
East Coast rap clean. It all started anew. Every guy in Wu-Tang would
go on to record their own albums as side-project, and every one of those
albums would spawn a whole new sub-style of hip-hop. Wu-Tang was like some
kind of amazing chain reaction in the world of music. It just kept on going
and going, changing everything it touched. Sort of the exact opposite of
the way popular rock was managing to completely not influence anyone at
all in the 1990s. This song <span 
class="cmbx-10">Protect Ya Neck </span>is the track that started it
all.

<!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" >When Nick Cave was a kid, he liked to listen to Blind Willie Johnson, and Serge
Gainsbourg, and Johnny Cash. But he <span 
class="cmti-10">loved </span>Leonard Cohen. He wanted to <span 
class="cmti-10">be</span>

Leonard Cohen. Except he also wanted to do a lot of Heroin and sing loud songs. So
that&#8217;s what he did. For decades he was a crazy person. He had a gang of filthy brutes
with thick Australian accents nobody could understand (and one German dude)
and they wouldn&#8217;t play their instruments so much as beat the crap out of
them. But when you <span 
class="cmti-10">could </span>understand what Nick was singing, your found
astonishing and beautiful dark lyrics which were scary, disturbing, gross,
and romantic all at the same time. And oddly enough most of them were
about God. Sometime in the 1990s he stopped doing Heroin and his style
mellowed out a lot, and suddenly (since you could now understand what he was
singing) everyone loved Nick Cave and his amazing lyrics. This song <span 
class="cmbx-10">I Let</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Love In </span>is from before that happened, but if you pay attention to the lyrics
you can see why people like him so much. There&#8217;s only a handful of people
in the history of music, maybe even entire the history of humanity, who
can make a whole career of putting words to music in a way that makes
the music transcend the words, and the words transcend the music at the
same time&#8212;and the sum ends up greater than any of the parts. (Most of
them are somewhere on this list.) But Nick Cave is my favorite of them
all.

<!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" >Will Oldham, also sometimes known as Bonnie &#8216;Prince&#8217; Billie, is one more guy worth
knowing about with an uncanny knack for turning out songs which make your
insides squishy. Sometime his lyrics are dark. Sometimes they are beautiful.
But he can take a plain-seeming phrase and stick it to a bit of music, and
somehow it just bends into spine-tingly awesomeness. Kind of like if Dolly
Parton were a grumpy guy with a big beard who sometimes sang about
frightening things. He has made lots and lots of recordings and they aren&#8217;t all
amazing. (Largely because he likes playing music a lot, so maybe he doesn&#8217;t
always work as hard on the lyrics as he could.) But he has written at least
a dozen world-class songs&#8212;as good as anything ever written. This one, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">See A Darkness</span>, was so good that Johnny Cash himself did a version of
it.<br

<span 
class="cmti-10">&#8220;what about Bob Dylan and David Bowie, surely they should be included, you</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">even mention them a couple of times!&#8221; They are not included for the simple</span>
<span
