 id="x1-10001"></a>Blind Willie Johnson</h3>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >In the beginning, before the Beatles, before Bob Dylan, and before Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young, the only thing there was was a crazy artist living in New York City
named Harry Smith. He collected records of old-timey mountain folks from
the south singing songs that got passed down from one family member to
another for generations. You saw &#8220;Oh Brother, Where art thou?&#8221;&#8212;they
were songs like that. In the 1950s Harry made the most famous music mix
ever. He put all his favorite songs out on six records called <span 
class="cmti-10">The Anthology</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">of American Folk Music</span>. Everyone cool in NYC and London listened to
those records. They listened to them thousands of times until they wore
out the needles on their record players. Those records had jug bands, and
blues songs, murder ballads, and dudes who slid their knife up and down the
guitar strings to make crazy sounds. Nobody had ever heard anything like it
                                                                  

                                                                  
before (at least not coming out of a record player.) And then all those cool
people in NYC and London started writing their own songs, imitating the
styles they heard on the Anthology records. By then it was the 1960s and
the bands those cool people were forming played the music that became
what you know as &#8220;folk&#8221; music. One of the guys on the anthology was Blind
Willie Johnson. He played the song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">John the Revelator</span>. Every song on
the anthology is important, and those songs influenced all sorts of people
(including Bob Dylan who, as you know, is a legend in his own time.) But
Blind Willie might be the most important person on the Anthology. In a
whole collection of songs that sounded like nothing else before, <span 
class="cmti-10">John the</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Revelator </span>sounded like something from some future era of humanity that for
some reason decided to pop up in the rural south in the early part of the
20th Century. Blind Willie was blinded when his mom threw a pan of lye
(a cleaning chemical) in his face when he was a kid. And he is kind of a
mysterious figure, not much is known about him (other than the lye thing).
A lot of the songs on the Anthology were about pretty nasty things, but
Blind Willie Johnson was very religious. He sang about God, mostly. I like to
imagine that he was kind of like a ghost, a guy who stood with one foot
planted on earth and the other on some higher plane. But even if he was
just a poor, blind, devout dude with a gravelly voice, he is one of the most
important people in the history of music. One of his songs is actually on
board the Voyager spacecraft &#8212; which actually left the solar system a couple
of years ago. (And, also, is the evil alien force in Star Trek, The Motion
Picture.)

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>James Brown</h3>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Have you listened to any James Brown yet? If you haven&#8217;t, you have a lot of
catching up to do. His band was probably made up of the greatest musicians
that ever lived. Nobody can play like those guys. And this music he made,
sometimes called soul, sometimes called funk, set the basis for dance music
for the next 50 years. (Dance music&#8212;you know, music you dance to, as
opposed to sit around and sing along with&#8212;it&#8217;s a pretty important part of
music.) He started putting these songs out in the 1960s, and when people
heard those songs, that just <span 
class="cmti-10">had </span>to start dancing. They couldn&#8217;t help it. The
lyrics are funny, but listen to that music! Before James Brown, dancing
was kinda boring (there were a lot of rules for how to do it right). After
him, it was fun. Turns out people like fun dancing a lot more than boring
dancing. This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Mother Popcorn </span>is about popcorn. And mothers,
apparently.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                  

                                                                  
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Leonard Cohen</h3>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Lots of people (ELA teachers mostly) complain that most people don&#8217;t like poetry
anymore. But this isn&#8217;t true at all. What actually happened is that a bunch of the
greatest poets of the 20th century happened to be writing rock songs instead of
&#8220;poetry&#8221;. And nobody <span 
class="cmti-10">ever </span>complains that most people don&#8217;t like rock songs, right?
Leonard Cohen is a Canadian dude who is one of the greatest song writers of all
time. (So a lot of people think he is one of the greatest poets of all time too.) He
started writing songs in the 1960s. (He was probably listening to the Anthology
of American Folk Music like everyone else.) He wrote that song <span 
class="cmti-10">Suzanne</span>
(&#8220;...brings you tea and oranges, that come all the way from China...&#8221;&#8212;you know
it.) And he also wrote that song <span 
class="cmti-10">Allelujah </span>which you would recognize if
you heard it. He wrote dozens of songs that will give you chills if you pay
attention to what he sings in them. Your Uncle Kevin says, &#8220;The man has
class, heart, and cool.&#8221; This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Famous Blue Raincoat</span>, is one of his
best. It&#8217;s better than <span 
class="cmti-10">Suzanne </span>or <span 
class="cmti-10">Allelujah</span>, even if more people know those
songs.
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40004"></a>Serge Gainsbourg</h3>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Serge Gainsbourg was a French man you never heard of. He was an ugly
little troll who all the most beautiful women in the world were in love with
because he wrote amazing songs. Those songs were in French though, so most
Americans have never heard of him. The music is amazing and complex, but still
catchy. (He liked to hire really amazing musicians to play for him.) And if you
listen to enough, somehow you can just tell that the lyrics are deeply poetic
and tricky. Even though you don&#8217;t understand them because they are in
French. <span 
class="cmbx-10">The Ballad of Melody Nelson </span>is one song from a whole album
about a girl on a bicycle that he hits with his Rolls Royce&#8212;and then falls
in love with. It is considered one of the greatest albums ever recorded (in
French.)
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50005"></a>Dolly Parton</h3>
<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >Dolly Parton is one of the few people included in this list who is both a world-class
singer and a world-class songwriter at the same time. Her singing is shocking&#8212;just
listen to it&#8212;she has access to vocal registers that &#8220;cut me to the quick&#8221; as the old
humbug wizard says. Her voice just tears right through your sad little heart. But the
thing that really make Dolly special is that she pairs that voice with the
exceptionally good songs that she writes. Leonard Cohen probably generally writes
better lyrics than Dolly Parton (well he pretty much writes better lyrics than
<span 
class="cmti-10">everybody</span>) but he can&#8217;t back his lyrics up with a voice like Dolly Parton&#8217;s. And when
she puts those two things together it becomes something that makes you
                                                                  

                                                                  
feel a little spoiled to be able to find it on this humble Earth. Dolly makes
country music of course. And the best country songs are either really funny, or
terribly sad like this one, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I Will Always Love You</span>. She has funny ones
too.
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60006"></a>Johnny Cash</h3>
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >Johnny Cash you know, because you saw that movie. But you should really listen to
a lot <span 
class="cmti-10">more </span>Johnny Cash. He did not write many of his own songs, and is not one of
the greatest song writers of the 20th century. Mostly he took other people&#8217;s great
songs and through some kind of magic that I can&#8217;t really figure out, he made them
matter a lot more. Sometimes even when the original song was <span 
class="cmti-10">terrible</span>. My guess is
that his trick was to use his very stripped-down style to make other people&#8217;s songs,
that seemed ridiculous and complicated, simple and serious (&hellip;or funny!) It
didn&#8217;t hurt that he had that mega-rock-star status going for him. This song,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">A Boy Named Sue </span>was written by Shel Silverstein. (You know the guy
who wrote <span 
class="cmti-10">Where the Sidewalk Ends</span>?&#8212;same guy.) He played it for the first
time in San Quentin prison. That part is in the movie. The second most
important dude in the history of country music is Merle Haggard. He was at the
show Johnny Cash played in San Quentin, because he in prison there at the
time.
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70007"></a>Nancy Sinatra</h3>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Nancy Sinatra is the daughter of Frank Sinatra (you know who he was right?) Most
people think she sings pretty well (though she&#8217;s no Dolly Parton). She sang more
than one of the James Bond theme songs. And she sang that song <span 
class="cmti-10">These</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">Boots Are Made For Walking</span>. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard that song. But like
Johnny Cash she didn&#8217;t write most of her songs. (For a lot of performers back
then, and even today, it&#8217;s pretty normal to have someone else write your
songs.) She had a friend named Lee Hazlewood who wrote all of her most
famous songs. And he <span 
class="cmti-10">was </span>one of the great song writers. But he wasn&#8217;t a
very good singer, so he usually got Nancy to do that for him (smart, huh?).
This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Sand</span>, is one of their best, even if a lot more people have heard
<span 
class="cmti-10">Boots</span>.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80008"></a>Kraftwerk</h3>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Kraftwerk are a couple of German guys who are also the most influential band in the
history of music. You&#8217;ve heard of the Beatles right? Kraftwerk is more important
                                                                  

                                                                  
than they are. Why have you never heard of Kraftwerk? Because mostly it was other
musicians who listened to them. A <span 
class="cmti-10">lot </span>of other musicians, who worked in a far wider
range of styles of music than the Beatles. What they did that is special is
they made pop music with electronic instruments. Mostly keyboards. That
sounds boring now, but nobody really did it before them. And <span 
class="cmti-10">everyone </span>did
it after them because they thought Kraftwerk was so cool. Any band you
have ever heard that has a keyboard in it, or a drum machine, or uses clips
from other music, probably was listening to Kraftwerk at some point. This
includes ALL the pop music from the 1980s, and ALL the dance music from
the 1970s and 1980s (like, disco, maybe you&#8217;ve heard of that?) Remember,
dance music is a <span 
class="cmti-10">really </span>big deal in the history of music. Even ALL of early
rap and hip hop musicians were listening to Kraftwerk! For some reason
those guys in the Bronx who started rapping in the 1980s (and so created a
whole new genre of music) thought Kraftwerk was awesome. But the thing is
that Kraftwerk wasn&#8217;t just breaking new ground with the instruments they
used, their songs are amazing little puzzles that are always about two things
at once. They are very simple melodies, with very simple lyrics, and very
simple singing. But if you pay close attention you realize that all of them
are special simple things that you can listen to over and over again and
get something new from them each time. Like any great music. This song,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Radioactivity </span>is both about radioactivity and about radios. With activity on
them.
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90009"></a>Parliament</h3>
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Parliament (or P-funk) played a lot of their best stuff in the 1970s and they kind of
picked up where James Brown left off. Like James Brown, they liked to cram as many
people on stage as they could. And all of them were world-class musicians. They
wrote crazy songs about aliens coming down from outer-space to make you dance.
Parliament&#8217;s music was still considered funk because they weren&#8217;t really using too
many electronic instruments. (After the dance groups switched to using lots
of electronic instruments, people started calling it disco.) They had a real
drummer and real instruments and funky beats. But their style was kind
of like the crazy electronic dance music that was right around the corner
because everyone was listening to Kraftwerk and thinking computer music and
keyboards were really cool. The song here is <span 
class="cmbx-10">Flashlight</span>, which has the
chorus, &#8220;everybody has a little light under the sun.&#8221; What do you think that
means?
<!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1000010"></a>Brian Eno</h3>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >Also in the 1970s (you had no idea the 1970s were so important to music, did you?)
                                                                  

                                                                  
there was this guy Brian Eno. Brian Eno knew every musician in NYC and London.
And they all wanted him to &#8220;produce&#8221; their albums. (That just means deciding
which instruments to use on a song and how loud each instrument should be&#8212;turns
out this is really important to making a song sound good.) Eno was some kind of
genius producer, as if God had reached down and tapped him on the head and said,
&#8220;thou shalt produce!&#8221; He claimed not to know anything about music, but every
album he touched magically turned into a classic of pop music. He worked with
Roxy Music, The Velvet Underground, U2, The Talking Heads, Genesis,
David Bowie, Devo and piles of others. But, and this is a big but, he also
wrote songs himself that have astonishing twisting lyrics that sometimes tell
creepy stories, and sometimes make you fall in love. And his songs sound like
nothing else before or since. He is one of the most important people in the
history of pop music. And this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I&#8217;ll Come Running</span>, is one of his
best.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1100011"></a>Donna Summer</h3>
<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >Donna Summer is famous for her disco songs. But what amazing disco songs they
are! The lyrics aren&#8217;t much, but her voice just soars. Her secret weapon though was
this guy Giorgio Moroder. He was another producer with a gift for turning other
people&#8217;s songs into pop hits. Not just ordinary pop hits&#8212;if you listen closely, the
sounds he creates are really complicated and have lots of smaller sounds that mush
together to create them. But he used more electronics and computers than
Brian Eno. His stuff sounded more like Kraftwerk. He turned this song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">Feel Love</span>, by Donna Summer into a work of art. When Brian Eno heard
it, he said, &#8220;I have heard the sound of the future.&#8221; At least, that&#8217;s what
David Bowie says he said. One way or another, this is the song that turned
dance music from funk (with real instruments) into disco (with electronic
instruments.) Giogio Moroder was behind a bunch of the best songs of the disco
era.
<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1200012"></a>Patti Smith</h3>
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >At the same time that Donna Summer was changing pop music, Patti Smith was
changing punk rock. Before her, punk rock was just a just bunch of dudes getting
drunk and breaking things and yelling &#8220;anarchy!&#8221; (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong
with that.) Patti Smith brought art and poetry and angry women to punk rock. Her
songs are intense and full of imagery (like images, of say, horses.) And her band does
that awesome thing where they start off soft and build up until you have to put your
fingers in your ears and if you squint you can almost see the raw energy pouring
off the stage. Lots of the best bands do that kind of thing. She is another
person who knew every famous person who passed through NYC in the 1970s.
                                                                  

                                                                  
Bruce Springsteen thought she was so cool he gave her one of his best songs!
(<span 
class="cmti-10">Because The Night</span>.) This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Land</span>, is one of her most important off her
album <span

music.

<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >Ok. There&#8217;s another guy who was living in NYC in the 1970s and 80s named David
Byrne. He had a band called The <span 
class="cmti-10">Talking Heads</span>. They wrote fun pop songs that
sounded good in the car when you were driving home from work. Turned out though
that they lyrics were about serial killers and arson and the end of the world. Like
Parliament and James Brown, David Byrne had the good sense to pack the stage
with unbelievable musicians and, you know, have Brian Eno produce his albums. He
topped it off by having awesome designers and artists do his album covers. Every cool
person in the world likes the Talking Heads. No joke. Go ahead and ask anyone cool
you meet. If you are ever at a party full of cool people and someone asks you to
put some music on, just throw on some Talking Heads. Everyone will think
you have good taste in music, but all you did was pick the one band that
every cool person likes. This song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Nothing But Flowers</span>, is about eating
chocolate chip cookies after the apocalypse. It&#8217;s my favorite. One of the
backup singers on this song is Kirsty MacColl. She is important to The Pogues
too.

<!--l. 223--><p class="noindent" >Tom Waits sings with a gravelly low voice that is supposed to make you think he
drank way too much whiskey and smoked far too many cigarettes. Maybe
he did, maybe he didn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s the schtick. Why does he want you to
think that? Because he wants you to think his main job is singing for tips in
a crappy bar. But don&#8217;t be fooled, this guy is one of the finest muscians
there is. And he packs his albums and shows full of world-class musicians.
And then on top of that he lays down tricky, funny, touching, lyrics that
are full of plays on words that make you giggle. All that, and all you have
to do is learn to like a little bit of a gravelly voice. Really, his voice isn&#8217;t
even as bad as Bob Dylan&#8217;s, and you know how much people will put up
with to listen to <span 
class="cmti-10">that </span>guy&#8217;s songs. This song is <span

<!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >The Pogues were an Irish rock band. They had this awesome idea that if you
combined traditional Irish music (you know with jigs and reels and whatnot) with
punk and rock music, you would make a really really popular band. They were right.
They were so right that nowadays there are about 1000 bands that sound
just like the Pogues. But the Pogues were there first, and they are a way
better band than all the rest. Why? Because there&#8217;s like nine dudes in the
Pogues and every one of them is among the best in the world at playing his
instrument. (Yet another band that uses that technique! Funny how well it works.)
But lots of the other Irish rock bands have good musicians. The Pogues
also had Shane MacGowan writing the songs for them. Songs just poured
out of Shane MacGowan, it seemed like he didn&#8217;t even have to try, he just
threw words out there and they would somehow fit with the jigs and reels
and rock in a way that gives you shivers. The only problem was he was
so drunk all the time you couldn&#8217;t understand a damn word he said. The
band eventually kicked him out for being drunk. But then they had to let
him back in, because they just weren&#8217;t as good without him. People like
well-played music, but they <span 
class="cmti-10">love </span>a catchy lyric and a good turn of phrase. This
song, <span 
class="cmbx-10">Fairtale of NY</span>, is a duet with Kirsty MacColl (who sang with the
Talking Heads, remember?) Her voice is shocking. Particularly on the lines,
&#8220;you could have been someone&#8212;well so could anyone!&#8221; (The producer did a
trick on that part where the vocals are doubled up so they sound like more
than one person singing.) She died young, saving her son from being run
over by a motorboat. In Europe this song has actually become a Christmas
classic, and people play it a lot during the holidays (probably an annoying
amount.) Nick Cave says the first line is the greatest first line ever written to a
song.

<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >In the 1990s everyone was really miserable. Mostly because they had to wear really
ugly clothes, and have bad haircuts, and nobody took showers. Plus, all the music
and movies just weren&#8217;t as good as they were in the 1960s, &#8217;70s, and &#8217;80s, and
nothing exciting really ever happened. Because of that, all the bands started singing
about how miserable they all were, and nobody was more miserable than
Kurt Cobain. So of course that meant he had the most popular band of the
time. He also had a gift for writing really good songs. They are one of those
bands that proves again that you can learn the bare minimum of actual
music, but if you know how to twist a phrase in a catchy way, and set it
to a good simple hook of music, people will worship the ground you walk
on like a conquering king of old. Of course that didn&#8217;t stop Kurt Cobain
from killing himself. We can only imagine how good Nirvana would have
been if they had musicians as good at the Pogues or Tom Waits. This song,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">All Apologies </span>shows that Nirvana wasn&#8217;t all just grumpy people making
                                                                  

                                                                  
noise.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">17   </span> <a 
 id="x1-1700017"></a>Wu-Tang Clan</h3>
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >In the 1990s popular rock music was getting really boring. Everything kind of
sounded the same, nobody was doing anything new. At the same time, popular
hip-hop was just launching a period that would make it the most influential genre in
music right up until today. In the early 1990s there was a battle going on in hip-hop
between the East Coast (which really means NYC) and the West Coast (which really
means Los Angeles.) In 1993 the West Coast was winning. Their hip-hop was was
very serious and very dark. Nothing the East Coast made could stand up to it.
Until some dudes in NYC did what NYC always does &#8212; they got really
smart. Wu-Tang Clan is the hip-hop group that became Staten Island&#8217;s
greatest cultural export. They put out an album in 1994 called Enter the
Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) that changed the way hip-hop worked. Wu-Tang is
another group that had the great idea of cramming as many super-talented
people on stage as they could fit. Each member would take turns rapping
a verse, and the verses were just as serious and dark as the Los Angeles
stuff, but also incredibly intelligent, tricky, loaded with double meaning, and
somehow funny at the same time. Every guy in Wu-Tang would go on to
record their own albums as side-project, and every one of those albums would
spawn a whole new sub-style of hip-hop. Wu-Tang was like some kind of
amazing chain reaction in the world of music, that just kept on going and
going, changing everything it touched. Sort of the exact opposite of the
way that popular rock was managing to completely not influence anyone at
all in the 1990s. This song <span 
class="cmbx-10">Protect Ya Neck </span>is the track that started it
all.

 id="x1-1800018"></a>Nick Cave</h3>
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >When Nick Cave was a kid, he liked to listen to Blind Willie Johnson, and Serge
Gainsbourg, and Johnny Cash. But he <span 
class="cmti-10">loved </span>Leonard Cohen. He wanted to be
Leonard Cohen, except he also wanted to do a lot of Heroin and sing really loud
songs. So that&#8217;s what he did. For decades he was a crazy person, he had a gang of
filthy brutes with thick Australian accents that nobody could understand (and one
German dude) and they wouldn&#8217;t really play their instruments so much as beat the
crap out of them. But when you could understand what Nick was singing, there were
astonishing and beautiful dark lyrics which were scary, disturbing, gross, and
romantic all at the same time. Sometime in the 1990s he stopped doing Heroin and
his style mellowed out a lot, and suddenly everyone loved Nick Cave and his
amazing lyrics. This song <span 
class="cmbx-10">I Let Love In </span>is from before that happened,
but if you pay attention to the lyrics you can see why people like him so
                                                                  

                                                                  
much.

 id="x1-1900019"></a>Will Oldham</h3>
<!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >Will Oldham, also sometimes known as Bonnie &#8216;Prince&#8217; Billie, is one more guy who
has an uncanny knack for turning out songs that make your insides squishy.
Sometime his lyrics are dark. Sometimes they are beautiful. But he can take a
plain-seeming phrase and stick it to a bit of music that somehow just makes it bend
into spine-tingly awesomeness. Kind of like if Dolly Parton were a grumpy guy with a
big beard and sang about frightening things. He has made lots and lots of recordings
and they aren&#8217;t all amazing (largely because he likes playing music a lot so sometimes
he doesn&#8217;t work as hard on the lyrics.) But he has written at least a dozen
songs that are world-class, as good as anything ever written. This one, <span 
class="cmbx-10">I See</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">A Darkness</span>, was so good that Johnny Cash himself did a version of it.
