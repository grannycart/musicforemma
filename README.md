# Music For Emma
* By Mark Torrey

## How to read it:
* Available to read on github pages here:
	* [Music For Emma](http://grannycart.net/MusicForEmma/)
* Or, compile from this source code using pandoc.
	* (Or just read the straight markdown, available in source.)

## Notes
* Music for Emma was originally written in Latex. I have since converted it to markdown. See the .md file. 
* Original "source code" file: [MusicForEmma.md](MusicForEmma)

## Compilation notes:
* Compiled using pandoc-ebook-template. For instructions see:
	* https://github.com/evangoer/pandoc-ebook-template
	* Also see Makefile for details.
* Basically: 
	1. on a linux box 
	2. make sure you have pandoc and latex installed 
	3. then just run make. This will create an epub, html, pdf, latex, and plain txt version of the book.
